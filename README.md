# RB_Capture
This is a stereo video capture demo based on dual webcam under linux.it use two webcam(one acts as left eyes and the other acts as right eys) based on V4l2 video to capture images and mix R channelofleft image with GB channel of right image to generate a Reb-Blue stereo image buffer and use SDL2 API to Draw it on the Screen. if you have any  problem to use it,you can contact with me by email: mater_lai@163.com	
for experience you will need meet two following conditions:
	(1)SDL2 Devel packages is installed 
	(2)you also need a REB-BLUE 3D glasses(very cheap).
you can execute make command in the directory to start building to generate RB_Capture Execute object,then you can go to experience it.if you feel stetro effect is not good,you can adjust the margin between left image and right image to make the shade  perfect match and it will make a better stereo effect !
